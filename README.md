# Jest Test React

Here you will find a very very small application with some tests using the [Test Renderer](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-renderer.html) by facebook itself and using airbnb's [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html).

The tests can be found in the folder: [src/tests](src/tests)
